A few weeks ago, I created a UI library based on Tukan's jsfx, to simplify the process of adding a GUI to js effects. I began by sharing some examples of classic js that could benefit from a facelift using designs from Analog Obsession, Tukan, Pitufodelbosque, and ReArtist. The positive feedback encouraged me to develop original designs from scratch.

Now available on ReaPack with this repository:

As my library is based on Tukan's, it supports parameter group linking, UI scaling, shift/ctrl modifiers, etc. However, some effects don't provide parameter linking such as Smooth Limiter by GeraintLuff and Sonic Anomaly js.

The DSP on these jsfx is not mine; I merely made minor tweaks, such as adding sidechain, bypass, and merging effects. All credits belong to the rightful owners. Similarly, some assets, knobs, and buttons belong to Tukan Studios, ReArtist, and Pitufodelbosque.

The main purpose of this collection is to provide an embedded version. If you own any jsfx, feel free to contact me to have them removed from this collection or to implement these features on your effects.
